# SLiM Simulations Project

## Introduction
This project involves using SLiM (Selection on Linked Mutations) to perform evolutionary simulations. Each day, a different aspect of SLiM is explored to understand various genetic and evolutionary models.

## Prerequisites
To run these simulations, you will need the following:
- [SLiM 3.x](https://messerlab.org/slim/) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of population genetics.
- Python (or other language) for additional analysis if needed.

## Installation
1. Download SLiM from [SLiM website](https://messerlab.org/slim/).
2. Follow the [installation guide](https://messerlab.org/slim/installing/) provided for your operating system.
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   slim --version

## Each day, I will go through one topic and document my journey to learn SLiM
